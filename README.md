### Machine Learning Course - CODEALPHA
Welcome to the repository for the Machine Learning Course conducted by Codalpha. This repository contains all the tasks and exercises completed during the course. The tasks are designed to cover various foundational and advanced concepts in machine learning, with practical implementation in Python.

# Course Overview
The course provides an in-depth understanding of machine learning concepts, techniques, and applications. It emphasizes hands-on practice, encouraging participants to solve problems and implement algorithms from scratch.

# Key Topics Covered
1.Introduction to Machine Learning
Understanding machine learning concepts
Types of machine learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement

2.Data Preprocessing
Handling missing data
Feature scaling and normalization
Data splitting for training and testing

3.Supervised Learning
Regression models (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, etc.)
Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)

4.Unsupervised Learning
Clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
5.Model Evaluation and Optimization
Cross-validation
